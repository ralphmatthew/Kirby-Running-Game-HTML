Hi!! This code is a game made with the use of programming languages such as html, css and javascript. This is based on Google Chrome's dinosaur game wherein the user let the dinosaur jump and dodge cactuses.

I had a lot of time figuring out my mistakes and corrections in this code. Feel free to raise any issue or pull request of you ever used my code and encountered any problems. It would be an honor for me to learn and gain more experience in this language. Thank you.

I would also like to give proper credits to Knife Circus and Keep Coding. I used both of their videos as a guide to this code. You can check their tutorials by following the following links:
